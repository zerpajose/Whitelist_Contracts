This project implements a Whitelist contract, where addresses can be added to a Whitelist interacting with the contract.

Throug Hardhat framework you can try running some of the following tasks to compile, test or deploy the contract:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
node scripts/deploy.js
```
## Interact

You can interact with the contract through [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and the frontend (Next section).
